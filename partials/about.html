                        <h4>Objective:</h4> 
                        Score points by matching "X" to your goal number.  Avoid having "X" equal your opponents goal number.  Remember you have a limited time to complete your turns, so play quickly.

                        <h4>Rules:</h4> 
                        Each player will start with 3 random cards.  Each card has a function to perform on "X".  When a card is played it is added to the end of the "Played Cards" list, then each card's function is performed on "X" in that order.  If, between card functions, "X" is equal to a player's goal, they score a point.  If "X" is equal at the end of all the cards' functions, they get 3 points.  Players take turns playing cards, starting with a randomly determined player.  Each player gets 5 turns and has a total of 5 minutes to make their plays.
